The Missouri S&T Mars Rover Design Team is a dedicated group of students who focus on designing, building, and testing rovers for participation in the [University Rover Challenge (URC)](https://urc.marssociety.org). As part of this team, I developed software, enhanced communications infrastructure, created testing platforms and processes, and served as the CEO/President through the 2020-21 "Covid-19" school year.

### Software Development
I initially joined and developed software, collaborating with others, understanding and improving the basestation and autonomy code. I then became the software lead, recruting and developing more members into software projects to improve and expand the rover's control systems.

### Software Architect
Over time, additional software development required architectural considerations and a rigorous process for testing. I moved into an architect role to build a testing framework, implementng practices for isolating changes, and to conduct code reviews.

### CEO / President
In my final year of college, I was the elected CEO of the team, leading our 50+ active member team through a turbulent Covid-19 school year (2020-2021). At the outset, we did not know if we would be on campus, or even be able to collaborate in person. While there ultimately was no competition, we still built a rover and ran a "mock" competition to put our members through the process to prepare for future years. I couldn't have been prouder.
