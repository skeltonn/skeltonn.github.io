# Hey, I'm Nathan.

I'm a software engineer and technology enthusiast from St. Louis, Missouri, currently residing in Omaha, Nebraska. My childhood interest in building and creating all sorts of things has morphed into a career doing just that.

In high school, I chose software engineering to express that passion, leading me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Missouri University of Science and Technology.

When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me enjoying the outdoors through cycling, hiking, or camping. I have a goal to visit every National Park, and I'm roughly a quarter of the way there.

My adventures are commonly paired with a good book. Some of my recent recommendations:

<ul>
    <li>"The Second Mountian" by David Brooks</li>
    <li>"The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg</li>
</ul>

A cherished tradition from my childhood: I'm a die-hard Cardinals baseball fan. My apologies to any Cubs fans I meet.

If you share my passion for technology, love for exploration, or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out.
